Many CPUs are optimized to read and write memory at aligned addresses, often in multiples of the word size (e.g., 4 bytes on a 32-bit system, 8 bytes on a 64-bit system).<li><strong>Efficient Memory Access</strong>: Aligned memory accesses can often be performed with fewer CPU instructions. For example, fetching a 4-byte integer from an address that is a multiple of 4 can be done in a single memory access on many architectures.<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Alignment ensures that the same data type has the same memory layout across different systems, which is important for portability and consistency in software behavior.<li><strong>Padding</strong>: Without proper alignment, compilers may need to add padding between data structures to ensure that each element is correctly aligned. This can lead to inefficient use of memory. By aligning data correctly, the need for padding is minimized, leading to more efficient memory usage.</ul></main><footer id=site-footer></footer>
