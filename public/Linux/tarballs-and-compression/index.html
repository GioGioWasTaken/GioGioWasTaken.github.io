Making them a linear format.<p>Tar, short for "tape archive," is a command-line utility used to create, manipulate, and extract files from archives in the Unix and Linux environments. Without compression, tar simply combines multiple files and directories into a single archive file, with the .tar extension. It does not compress the files; it only bundles them together.<h3 id=zipping-compression-of-tar-files>Zipping/compression of tar files</h3><p>tar files are not zipped on their own. Most of the time they are compressed using <code>gzip</code>, which uses the deflate algorithm to zip files.<h3 id=why-are-compressed-files-so-useful>Why are compressed files so useful?</h3><p>Since modern CPU's are much faster than internet connection, it is more efficient for one machine to compress, and for the other to decompress, than to transfer a fully sized file over the internet.<h3 id=why-tar-over-zip>Why tar over zip?</h3><p>zip files are built for windows, and are not made to hold all the custom proprities a Linux file might have (think about what you see when you use <code>ls -l</code> on a file.)<h3 id=why-zip-over-tar>Why zip over tar?</h3><p>.zip files are more like .gz.tar files. They append already compressed versions. Which means we can decompress files by index.<h3 id=tar-gz-and-gz-tar-each-have-their-advantage>tar.gz and gz.tar each have their advantage</h3><h3 id=why-do-files-weigh-so-much-before-finishing-compilation>Why Do Files Weigh So Much Before Finishing Compilation?</h3><ol><li><strong>Intermediate Files</strong>: The build process generates many intermediate files, such as object files (<code>.o</code>), precompiled headers, and temporary files.<li><strong>Debug Information</strong>: Compiling with debug information (<code>-g</code> flag) creates larger files to store symbols and other debugging data.<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: The build process might include numerous dependencies, each contributing to the overall size.<li><strong>Multiple Build Configurations</strong>: Some build systems compile multiple versions (e.g., debug and release) simultaneously.<li><strong>Source Files</strong>: The source code itself, including documentation and auxiliary files, adds to the total size.<li><strong>Build Artifacts</strong>: The build system might produce additional artifacts like logs, temporary build files, and cache files.</ol><p>Once the compilation is complete, many of these intermediate and temporary files are not needed and can be deleted, significantly reducing the final size of the installed software.</main><footer id=site-footer></footer>
