The Owl and the Pinecone</h2><p>Once, an owl fell in love with a pinecone. She built a nest of the finest feathers, waiting for it to speak. It never did. The owl grew wise and flew away. The lesson?<p>fuck pinecones. They are evil and wish for your demise.<h2 id=2-the-farmer-and-the-raindrop>2. The Farmer and the Raindrop</h2><p>A farmer waited for rain for 10 years. Finally, a single drop fell, and the farmer rejoiced. Then it evaporated. The lesson? Sometimes it's better not to wait. Especially for water.<h2 id=3-the-cat-and-the-moon>3. The Cat and the Moon</h2><p>A cat climbed to the roof to catch the moon. It pounced, fell off, and landed in a puddle. The cat never tried again but claimed victory anyway. The lesson? If you fail, just tell everyone you succeeded.<h2 id=4-the-frog-and-the-mountain>4. The Frog and the Mountain</h2><p>A frog dreamed of climbing a mountain. It leaped once, and fell back into the mud. It realized the mud was more comfortable. The lesson? Ambition is overrated. Mud is good.<h2 id=5-the-sparrow-and-the-lake>5. The Sparrow and the Lake</h2><p>A sparrow landed by a lake, thirsty but stubborn. It refused to drink, for the water had touched the moon’s reflection. It died thirsty. The lesson? Principles are great until they kill you.<h2 id=6-the-merchant-and-the-stone>6. The Merchant and the Stone</h2><p>A merchant traded his finest goods for a polished stone, thinking it magical. When he held it to the moonlight, it did nothing. He sold it to a fool for twice the price. The lesson? If it’s useless to you, sell it for profit.<h2 id=7-theramesius-and-the-pebble>7. Theramesius and the Pebble</h2><p>A disciple asked Theramesius, “Great one, what is stronger, the mountain or the pebble?” Theramesius picked up the pebble and threw it at the disciple’s head. The lesson? Don’t ask stupid questions. Pebbles hurt.<h1 id=famous-quotes-in-the-rockcentricview>Famous quotes in the Rockcentricview</h1><p>"Be like a rock. Never admit you are wrong. Let others stumble on you. "<p>"Water bends, but rock remains. Therefore rock is of great glory."</main><footer id=site-footer></footer>
