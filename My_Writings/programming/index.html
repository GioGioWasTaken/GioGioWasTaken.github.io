<h1></h1><p>The mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is the maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas and not material.</p>
<p>All mathematics are built on the principle that if and only if a statement is always true, then X. If X, then Y.</p>
<p>The programmer is the master of abstraction. The programmer hates futility and he therefore builds castles on top of castles.</p>
<p>The programmer is a mathematician, that had the gall to commit the blasphemous act of building castles on top of a physical and not purely logical object.</p>
<p>The digital world is an extension of the natural world. It exists only as a mathematical idea.</p>
<p>All computer programs are truly nothing more than mathematical objects.</p>
<p>Programming is an experiment in taking a logical tour of a system from state A to B. Whether a system is electrical or not is of little importance.</p>
<p>It is the art of the programmer to understand a problem and strip it down to its most basic components.</p>
<p>A programmer must understand a system in a perfect manner to truly computerize it.</p>
<p>Ah and even so, it executes.</p>
<p>Computer Programming is truly a profane act.</p>
