If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas and not material.<p>All mathematics are built on the principle that if and only if a statement is always true, then X. If X, then Y.<p>The programmer is the master of abstraction. The programmer hates futility and he therefore builds castles on top of castles.<p>The programmer is a mathematician, that had the gall to commit the blasphemous act of building castles on top of a physical and not purely logical object.<p>The digital world is an extension of the natural world. It exists only as a mathematical idea.<p>All computer programs are truly nothing more than mathematical objects.<p>Programming is an experiment in taking a logical tour of a system from state A to B. Whether a system is electrical or not is of little importance.<p>It is the art of the programmer to understand a problem and strip it down to its most basic components.<p>A programmer must understand a system in a perfect manner to truly computerize it.<p>Ah and even so, it executes.<p>Computer Programming is truly a profane act.</main><footer id=site-footer></footer>
