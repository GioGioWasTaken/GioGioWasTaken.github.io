Simply a miscellaneous collection of my thoughts.</h3><p>Older generations, especially those who grew up with analog clocks, tend to estimate time in rounded chunks (e.g., 5:15 instead of 5:12) because they were trained to think in relative positions rather than exact numbers.<p>On an analog clock, the difference between :12 and :15 is barely noticeable at a glanceâ€”both are in the same general region (quarter-past). Their brains prioritize approximate visual cues over precise numerical readings.<p>This habit often carries over to digital clocks, even when precision is available, because their mental model of time is still shaped by the analog format.<p>I believe this is the reason whenever I ask an older person the time, they always round it rather then say the exact time down to the minute.</main><footer id=site-footer></footer>
