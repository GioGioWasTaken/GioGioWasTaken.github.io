<h1></h1><h2 id="tarballs">Tarballs</h2>
<p>Tarballs are an archiving file format.</p>
<h3 id="archiving">Archiving</h3>
<p>Archiving is the action of taking many files, and essentially appending them to one another. Making them a linear format.</p>
<p>Tar, short for "tape archive," is a command-line utility used to create, manipulate, and extract files from archives in the Unix and Linux environments. Without compression, tar simply combines multiple files and directories into a single archive file, with the .tar extension. It does not compress the files; it only bundles them together.</p>
<h3 id="zipping-compression-of-tar-files">Zipping/compression of tar files</h3>
<p>tar files are not zipped on their own. Most of the time they are compressed using <code>gzip</code>, which uses the deflate algorithm to zip files.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-compressed-files-so-useful">Why are compressed files so useful?</h3>
<p>Since modern CPU's are much faster than internet connection, it is more efficient for one machine to compress, and for the other to decompress, than to transfer a fully sized file over the internet.</p>
<h3 id="why-tar-over-zip">Why tar over zip?</h3>
<p>zip files are built for windows, and are not made to hold all the custom proprities a Linux file might have (think about what you see when you use <code>ls -l</code> on a file.)</p>
<h3 id="why-zip-over-tar">Why zip over tar?</h3>
<p>.zip files are more like .gz.tar files. They append already compressed versions. Which means we can decompress files by index.</p>
<h3 id="tar-gz-and-gz-tar-each-have-their-advantage">tar.gz and gz.tar each have their advantage</h3>
<h3 id="why-do-files-weigh-so-much-before-finishing-compilation">Why Do Files Weigh So Much Before Finishing Compilation?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intermediate Files</strong>: The build process generates many intermediate files, such as object files (<code>.o</code>), precompiled headers, and temporary files.</li>
<li><strong>Debug Information</strong>: Compiling with debug information (<code>-g</code> flag) creates larger files to store symbols and other debugging data.</li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: The build process might include numerous dependencies, each contributing to the overall size.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Build Configurations</strong>: Some build systems compile multiple versions (e.g., debug and release) simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Source Files</strong>: The source code itself, including documentation and auxiliary files, adds to the total size.</li>
<li><strong>Build Artifacts</strong>: The build system might produce additional artifacts like logs, temporary build files, and cache files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the compilation is complete, many of these intermediate and temporary files are not needed and can be deleted, significantly reducing the final size of the installed software.</p>
