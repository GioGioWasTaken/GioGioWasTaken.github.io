<h1></h1><h2 id="problem-domain-points">Problem domain points</h2>
<ul>
<li>A problem domain is anything outside of programming that a software engineer needs to understand to produce correct code that can achieve the desired effects. “Directly” means include anything that the software can control to produce the desired effects, e.g. keyboards, printers, moni- tors, other software, etc. “Indirectly” means anything not part of the soft-ware but relevant to the problem domain.</li>
<li>Often, it is too much for a software engineer to learn non-trivial do- mains (that might require a bachelor degree or above to understand the domains).</li>
<li>If a programmer writes software for a living, he had bet- ter be specialized in one or two problem domains outside of software if he does not want his job taken by domain experts who learn program- ming in their spare time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documents">Documents</h2>
<p>Documents are essential for learning a problem domain (and actually, anything) since information can be passed down in a reliable way. It is evident that this written text has been used for thousands of years to pass knowledge from generation to generation. Documents are integral parts of non-trivial projects. Without the documents:
- New people will find it much harder to join a project.
- It is harder to maintain a project because people may forget important unresolved bugs or quirks in their system.
- It is challenging for customers to understand the product they are going to use. However, documents do not need to be written in book for- mat. It can be anything from HTML format to database format to be displayed by a graphical user interface. Important information must be stored somewhere safe, readily accessible.</p>
<h2 id="opearting-systems">Opearting systems:</h2>
<p>Operating systems simply make developing easier, by removing parts unrelated to the problem domain. There's no need for a developer to focus on making keyboard drives, a basic necessity for practically any applicaiton, when an interface that works for 99% of cases may be suitable. OSes make the devloping part of of software far easier.</p>
